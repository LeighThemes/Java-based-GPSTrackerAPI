**<h1>Java-based GPSTrackerAPI</h1>**

Java-based GPSTrackerAPI is a specialized modification tailored for the NASA World Wind Java SDK, available at NASA World Wind Java SDK. This enhancement empowers developers to effortlessly implement GPS tracking functionality using the MATLABS API, making it possible to track an individual's location on a global scale.

Please note that the process of integrating this modification may require adaptations depending on your operating system and integrated development environment (IDE). It is crucial to be aware that this code was designed for the 2020 version of WorldWindJava, and potential conflicts may arise due to subsequent SDK updates.

<h2>Replication Steps</h2>

To incorporate the Java-based GPSTrackerAPI into your project, follow these comprehensive steps:

    1. Locate the GPSTracker.java File:
        Navigate to the GPSTracker.java file within the gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples package.
        The file path typically resembles the following: WorldWindJava > src > gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples > GPSTracker.java.

    2. Code Replacement:
        Replace the existing code in the original GPSTracker.java file with the contents of the modified file included in this repository.
        Alternatively, you have the option to create a new file named GPSTracksAPI while keeping the original GPSTracker.java intact.

    3. Download MATLABS App:
        Obtain the MATLABS app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Note that a basic understanding of the MATLABS API is necessary to implement the code's functionality.

    4. Run the Tracker:
        Execute the individual file, specifically the "GPSTracksAPI.java" file, to initiate the GPS tracking functionality.

    5. Utilize the MATLABS App:
        Harness the capabilities of the MATLABS app to execute custom code and leverage the features of the integrated Java-based GPSTrackerAPI.

By following these structured steps, you can seamlessly integrate GPS tracking capabilities into your Java-based application using the NASA World Wind Java SDK. This modification provides exciting new possibilities for the development of location-based applications and services.

We encourage you to contribute to the development of this API by reporting issues, seeking assistance, or submitting relevant issues and pull requests. Our ongoing commitment is to continuously enhance and expand the functionality of the Java-based GPSTrackerAPI to better support the broader development community.
