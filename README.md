Java-based GPSTrackerAPI is a custom modification for the NASA World Wind Java SDK (https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava), designed to empower developers to create GPS tracking functionality using the MATLABS API and app store applications. With this API, you can effortlessly track an individual's location on a global scale.

Please note that the modification process can vary depending on your operating system and integrated development environment (IDE). Therefore, you may need to implement specific workarounds to ensure the program functions correctly.
Replication Steps

To integrate the Java-based GPSTrackerAPI into your project, follow these steps:

    Locate the GPSTracker.java file within the gov.nasa.worldwindx.examples package.

    Replace the existing code in the original GPSTracker.java file with the contents of the modified file provided in this repository.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate GPS tracking capabilities into your Java-based application using the NASA World Wind Java SDK. This modification opens up new possibilities for location-based applications and services.

Please feel free to report any issues, seek assistance, or contribute to the development of this API by submitting relevant issues and pull requests. We aim to continuously improve and expand the functionality of the Java-based GPSTrackerAPI to better serve the development community.
